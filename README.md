# Evolution of trichromacy in primates.

In class exercise for BI 163. Students will use provided data to

1. Use a “molecular clock” to estimate divergence dates for primate groups.

2. Compare amino acid sequences to identify non-polar to polar changes

3. Plot the change in opsin frequency shift to show adaptation to trichromacy.

4. Use divergence to predict whether New World monkeys should have trichromacy? Not sure yet how I'll do this section.

## Teaching goals

* Molecular clock: shows how molecular clocks can be used to esimate timing of evolutionary events. 

* Gene duplication: show role of gene duplication for generating phenotypic diversity among groups.

## Note: This exercise will, I think, replace the lecture section on homeotic genes. I'm not sure students are truly ready to understand their role in evolutionary events.  Perhaps a future exercise?
